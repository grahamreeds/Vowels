Vowels
======
This was in response to a question on Stackoverflow regarding a C++ question finding the number of
unique vowels in a string.

Obviously the easiest I can think of is `std::string("aeiou").find(c) != std::string::npos;` - 
which admittedly a couple of people present - but I wanted to do something slightly different.

This is what I came up with.
